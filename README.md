# Personal Website

A personal website with a brief bio, selected portfolio projects, a professional resume, and specified skills. Hosted via Github; written with Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.

### To do:

- Work on project links––web-transform frequently messes with the z-index of the project titles.
- Test responsiveness on smaller screens (sub-350px).
